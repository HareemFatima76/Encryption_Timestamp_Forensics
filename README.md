# Encryption_Timestamp_Forensics
A digital forensics research project exploring how encryption processes specifically using VeraCrypt can generate reliable timestamps that support time verification and timeline reconstruction. The project uses tools like FTK and Magnet AXIOM to analyze forensic images and evaluate the value of encryption artifacts.
